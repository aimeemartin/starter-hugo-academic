I am a postdoc at the University of Giessen working in Professor Karl Gegenfurtner's color lab.  

My previous work was on how attention can be distributed to relative features using attention and visual working memory paradigms. Side projects included work on attention to emotional faces.

My current work is on how attention is directed to color categories, using a range of different attentional paradigms with eye tracking and EEG methods.
