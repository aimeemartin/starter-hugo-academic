abstract: Many everyday tasks require selecting relevant objects in the visual field
  while ignoring irrelevant information. A widely held belief is that attention is
  tuned to the exact feature value(s) of a sought-after target object (e.g., color,
  shape). In contrast, subsequent studies have shown that attentional orienting (capture)
  is often determined by the relative feature(s) that the target has relative to other
  irrelevant items surrounding (e.g., redder, larger). However, it is unknown whether
  conscious awareness is also determined by relative features. Alternatively, awareness
  could be more strongly determined by exact feature values, which seem to determine
  dwelling on objects. The present study examined eye movements in a color search
  task with different types of irrelevant distractors to test (a) whether dwelling
  is more strongly influenced by exact feature matches than relative matches, and
  (b) which of the processes (capture vs. dwelling) is more important for conscious
  awareness of the distractor. A second experiment used an electrophysiological marker
  of attention (N2pc in the electroencephalogram of participants) to test whether
  the results generalize to covert attention shifts. As expected, the results revealed
  that the initial capture of attention was strongest for distractors matching the
  relative color of the target, whereas similarity to the target was the most important
  determiner for dwelling. Awareness was more strongly determined by the initial capture
  of attention than dwelling. These results provide important insights into the interplay
  of attention and awareness and highlight the importance of considering relative,
  context-dependent features in theories of awareness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c)
