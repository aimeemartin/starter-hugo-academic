 abstract = {Many everyday tasks require selecting relevant objects in the visual field while ignoring irrelevant information. A widely held belief is that attention is tuned to the exact feature value(s) of a sought-after target object (e.g., color, shape). In contrast, subsequent studies have shown that attentional orienting (capture) is often determined by the relative feature(s) that the target has relative to other irrelevant items surrounding (e.g., redder, larger). However, it is unknown whether conscious awareness is also determined by relative features. Alternatively, awareness could be more strongly determined by exact feature values, which seem to determine dwelling on objects. The present study examined eye movements in a color search task with different types of irrelevant distractors to test (a) whether dwelling is more strongly influenced by exact feature matches than relative matches, and (b) which of the processes (capture vs. dwelling) is more important for conscious awareness of the distractor. A second experiment used an electrophysiological marker of attention (N2pc in the electroencephalogram of participants) to test whether the results generalize to covert attention shifts. As expected, the results revealed that the initial capture of attention was strongest for distractors matching the relative color of the target, whereas similarity to the target was the most important determiner for dwelling. Awareness was more strongly determined by the initial capture of attention than dwelling. These results provide important insights into the interplay of attention and awareness and highlight the importance of considering relative, context-dependent features in theories of awareness.
