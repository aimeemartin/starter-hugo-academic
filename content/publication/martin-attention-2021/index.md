abstract: Attention is an important function that allows us to selectively enhance
  the processing of relevant stimuli in our environment. Fittingly, a number of studies
  have revealed that potentially threatening/fearful stimuli capture attention more
  efficiently. Interestingly, in separate fMRI studies, threatening stimuli situated
  close to viewers were found to enhance brain activity in fear-relevant areas more
  than stimuli that were further away. Despite these observations, few studies have
  examined the effect of personal distance on attentional capture by emotional stimuli.
  Using electroencephalography (EEG), the current investigation addressed this question
  by investigating attentional capture of emotional faces that were either looming/receding,
  or were situated at different distances from the viewer. In Experiment 1, participants
  carried out an incidental task while looming or receding fearful and neutral faces
  were presented bilaterally. A significant lateralised N170 and N2pc were found for
  a looming upright fearful face, however no significant components were found for
  a looming upright neutral face or inverted fearful and neutral faces. In Experiment
  2, participants made gender judgements of emotional faces that appeared on a screen
  situated within or beyond peripersonal space (respectively 50 cm or 120 cm). Although
  response times did not differ, significantly more errors were made when faces appeared
  in near as opposed to far space. Importantly, ERPs revealed a significant N2pc for
  fearful faces presented in peripersonal distance, compared to the far distance.
  Our findings show that personal distance markedly affects neural responses to emotional
  stimuli, with increased attention towards fearful upright faces that appear in close
  distance.
