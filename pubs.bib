	abstract = {Many everyday tasks require selecting relevant objects in the visual field while ignoring irrelevant information. A widely held belief is that attention is tuned to the exact feature value(s) of a sought-after target object (e.g., color, shape). In contrast, subsequent studies have shown that attentional orienting (capture) is often determined by the relative feature(s) that the target has relative to other irrelevant items surrounding (e.g., redder, larger). However, it is unknown whether conscious awareness is also determined by relative features. Alternatively, awareness could be more strongly determined by exact feature values, which seem to determine dwelling on objects. The present study examined eye movements in a color search task with different types of irrelevant distractors to test (a) whether dwelling is more strongly influenced by exact feature matches than relative matches, and (b) which of the processes (capture vs. dwelling) is more important for conscious awareness of the distractor. A second experiment used an electrophysiological marker of attention (N2pc in the electroencephalogram of participants) to test whether the results generalize to covert attention shifts. As expected, the results revealed that the initial capture of attention was strongest for distractors matching the relative color of the target, whereas similarity to the target was the most important determiner for dwelling. Awareness was more strongly determined by the initial capture of attention than dwelling. These results provide important insights into the interplay of attention and awareness and highlight the importance of considering relative, context-dependent features in theories of awareness.

	abstract = {Attention is an important function that allows us to selectively enhance the processing of relevant stimuli in our environment. Fittingly, a number of studies have revealed that potentially threatening/fearful stimuli capture attention more efficiently. Interestingly, in separate fMRI studies, threatening stimuli situated close to viewers were found to enhance brain activity in fear-relevant areas more than stimuli that were further away. Despite these observations, few studies have examined the effect of personal distance on attentional capture by emotional stimuli. Using electroencephalography (EEG), the current investigation addressed this question by investigating attentional capture of emotional faces that were either looming/receding, or were situated at different distances from the viewer. In Experiment 1, participants carried out an incidental task while looming or receding fearful and neutral faces were presented bilaterally. A significant lateralised N170 and N2pc were found for a looming upright fearful face, however no significant components were found for a looming upright neutral face or inverted fearful and neutral faces. In Experiment 2, participants made gender judgements of emotional faces that appeared on a screen situated within or beyond peripersonal space (respectively 50 cm or 120 cm). Although response times did not differ, significantly more errors were made when faces appeared in near as opposed to far space. Importantly, ERPs revealed a significant N2pc for fearful faces presented in peripersonal distance, compared to the far distance. Our findings show that personal distance markedly affects neural responses to emotional stimuli, with increased attention towards fearful upright faces that appear in close distance.},
